<h2 id="about">About Me </h2>
I am a senior student in **[Department of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/)** at **[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)**, majoring in Automation. Currently, I am a software development intern in Advanced Graphics and Vision Group at **[Hikvision](http://www.hikvision.com/en/)**. I used to work with **[Prof. Tao Gao](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/)** in **[VCLA Lab](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/index.html)** at UCLA and **[Prof. Jiangang Lu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lujg)** at my home institution, Zhejiang University.
<br> <br>
My research interests include but are not limited to: Robotics, Computer Vision, and Image Processing & Analysis (especially medical images).

<h3>Pulmonary Image Analysis to Diagnose, Evaluate and Follow up Overall Disease Change</h3>
An unexpected thoracoscopy surgery in my sophomore year, both terrifying and inspiring, still echoes in my mind. That was when I came to realize how imaging technologies could positively impact the world with the potential to save millions of lives. So I chose this project as my graduation thesis. We tried to combine CT with modern computer-based image analysis techniques (computer vision, machine learning) to provide a model or tool for radiologists to better diagnose diseases. It is inspiring and challenging due to lack of generalization and well-defined edges.

<h3>LiDAR SLAM on a Mobile Robot -- Hikvision</h3>
As a software development intern, I did a lot of supportive work, including analyzing LiDAR protocol, designing a cloud visualization dashboard to render raw point cloud data, and building a point cloud preprocessing pipeline to amend dynamic distortion. Recently, I am learning and implementing SURF and SIFT algorithms separately and then compare the time costs of computing descriptors.

<h2 id="previous">Previous Projects </h2>
<h3>Model-Based Trajectory Optimization using Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming </h3>
In order to research on robot motion planning, we built a trajectory optimization library using IPOPT, a large-scale nonlinear optimizer, and physical engine Mujoco. Finally, we built a trajectory optimization library that can avoid collisions while satisfying all constraints, and designed a visualization module to evaluate it.

<h3>Robot Obstacle Avoidance System and Simulation using EKF-SLAM and VFH+ </h3>
Obstacle avoidance is an vital part for autonomous robots. In this project, we implemented VFH+ obstacle avoidance algorithm and in order to evaluate the effect, we desigend a robot simulation environment using EKF-SLAM for proximity detection. Then the whole system was migrated to LabView in preparation for real cyber-physical system and achieved superior results than many benchmark metrics.

<h3>Vision-Based Flight Control on a Self-Built Drone </h3>
In this project, a four-roter drone was designed, including original hardware modules and a flight control system. Then we implemented a little resource-hungry vision system on a Raspberry Pi to detect and track objects. After combining together, the self-built drone could track a slowly moving target and accomplish simple autopilot.

<h2 id="interest">Passion </h2>
- **Music:**
I am fond of rock and folk music. I started tp play the drums at a very young age and then started to play the acoustic guitar, which is still my favorite in my leisure time. My favorite guitar player is *Eric Clapton* and favorite song is *Hotel California (unplugged version, 1994)*.

- **Photography:**
Since I got my first digital SLR, I have fallen in love with photography, especially landscape photography, which makes me love traveling too. Click **[here](./gallery.html)** to see the gallery.

- **Volunteering:**
I love to devote myself to volunteer services. In the past two years, I guided visitors at the West Lake, taught students in remote rural areas, helped athletes during the sports meeting, assisted in conferences, and many more.

- **Taxonomy and Ethology:**
In high school, I got access to Biology Olympiad and was so fascinated by Taxonomy and Ethology. I have a dream that one day I can get closer to these amazing creatures in the wild and make a documentary film.

- **Cooking:**
The traditional culture behind Chinese food always attracts me and I often cook for my families at home.
