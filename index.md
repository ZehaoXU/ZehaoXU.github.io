<h2 id="about">About Me </h2>
I am a senior student in **[Department of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/)** at **[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)**, majoring in Automation. Currently, I am a software development intern in Advanced Graphics and Vision Group at **[Hikvision](http://www.hikvision.com/en/)**. I used to work with **[Prof. Tao Gao](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/)** in **[VCLA Lab](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/index.html)** at UCLA and **[Prof. Dongqin Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0097033)** at my home institution, Zhejiang University.

<h3>LiDAR SLAM on a Mobile Robot -- Hikvision</h3>
As a software development intern, I did a lot of supportive work, including analyzing LiDAR protocol, designing a cloud visualization dashboard to render raw point cloud data, and building a point cloud preprocessing pipeline to amend dynamic distortion. Recently, I am learning and implementing SURF and SIFT algorithms separately and then compare the time costs of computing descriptors.

<h3>Model-Based Trajectory Optimization using Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming </h3>
In order to research on robot motion planning, we built a trajectory optimization library using IPOPT, a large-scale nonlinear optimizer, and physical engine Mujoco. Finally, we built a trajectory optimization library that can avoid collisions while satisfying all constraints, and designed a visualization module to evaluate it.

<h3>Robot Obstacle Avoidance System and Simulation using EKF-SLAM and VFH+ </h3>
Obstacle avoidance is an vital part for autonomous robots. In this project, we implemented VFH+ obstacle avoidance algorithm and in order to evaluate the effect, we desigend a robot simulation environment using EKF-SLAM for proximity detection. Then the whole system was migrated to LabView in preparation for real cyber-physical system and achieved superior results than many benchmark metrics.

<h3>Vision-Based Flight Control on a Self-Built Drone </h3>
In this project, a four-roter drone was designed, including original hardware modules and a flight control system. Then we implemented a little resource-hungry vision system on a Raspberry Pi to detect and track objects. After combining together, the self-built drone could track a slowly moving target and accomplish simple autopilot.
